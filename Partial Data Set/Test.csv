Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing, take away the words that rhyme it doesn't mean a thing.And Aubrey was her name. We triped the light and danced togther to the moon, but where was June. No it never came around. If it did it never made a sound, maybe I was absent or was listening to fast, catching all the words, but then the meaning going past, but god I miss the girl, and I'd go a thousandtimes around the world just to be closer the her than to me.And Aubrey was her name, I never new her, but I loved her just the same, I loved her name. Wish that I had found the way and the reasons that would make her stay. I have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest. If I can't have the one I want , I'll do without the best. But how I miss the girl and I'd go a milliontimes around the world just to say she had been mine for a day,"

25,Boogie Street,Leonard Cohen,362,"O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,I never thought weâd meet.You kiss my lips, and then itâs done:Iâm back on Boogie Street.A sip of wine, a cigarette,And then itâs time to goI tidied up the kitchenette;I tuned the old banjo.Iâm wanted at the traffic-jam.Theyâre saving me a seat.Iâm what I am, and what I am,Is back on Boogie Street.And O my love, I still recallThe pleasures that we knew;The rivers and the waterfall,Wherein I bathed with you.Bewildered by your beauty there,Iâd kneel to dry your feet.By such instructions you prepareA man for Boogie Street.O Crown of Light, O Darkened One...I never thought weâd meet.You kiss my lips, and then itâs done:Iâm back on Boogie Street.So come, my friends, be not afraid.We are so lightly here.It is in love that we are made;In love we disappear.Though all the maps of blood and fleshAre posted on the door,Thereâs no one who has told us yetWhat Boogie Street is for.O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,I never thought weâd meet.You kiss my lips, and then itâs done:Iâm back on Boogie Street.A sip of wine, a cigarette,And then itâs time to go...I tidied up the kitchenette;I tuned the old banjo.Iâm wanted at the traffic-jam."
