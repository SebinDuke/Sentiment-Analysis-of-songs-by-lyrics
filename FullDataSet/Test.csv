3,A Century Ends,David Gray,308,angry,"Cast your eyes into the distance Try to focus on it all Find a spirit of resistance Instead of pride before the fall Forge some opposition From disparate strands It ain't the prettiest position As a century ends  Unstable situation Faces made of wax Streams of melting glass Sheets of butchered facts The roar of the machine Hooded hearts and jewelled hands And anger spilling out like gasoline As a century ends  Everything i seen, everything that i heard, Ain't even the tip of the iceberg Fire down memory lane So pass me my rose tinted glasses again  Through a fog of contradiction Out to the lake of tears See society admiring its own reflection Chase a light that shines and disappears Careful what you say 'cos reality offends Just sit back and let your soul decay As a century ends  And its easy to get weary As you fight to get it done gainst a popular theory That it's over 'fore it's even begun Strain the limit of compassion Tend a wound that never mends And honesty still out of fashion As a century ends As a century ends As a century ends....

56,Shades Of Gray,The Monkees,199,happy,"When the world and I were young, Just yesterday.  Life was such a simple game, A child could play.  It was easy then to tell right from wrong. Easy then to tell weak from strong. When a man should stand and fight, Or just go along.  But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. I remember when the answers seemed so clear  We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear. It was easy then to tell truth from lies Selling out from compromise Who to love and who to hate,  The foolish from the wise.  But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. [Instumental interlude]  It was easy then to know what was fair When to keep and when to share. How much to protect your heart And how much to care. But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. Only shades of gray. "

I don't even know his name I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie  You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe When you're with 'em You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him Throw him down pin him So lost in the moments when you're in them It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday Yesterday is over it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her Next time you show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game But you ?? the game Now you get to watch her leave out the window I guess that's why they call it window pain Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie  Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me But when it comes to love you're just as blinded Baby, please come back It wasn't you, baby it was me Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk I told you this is my fault Look me in the eye ball Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall Next time. There won't be no next time I apologize even though I know its lies I'm tired of the games I just want her back I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie  "

76,Time Enough For Tears (Borrowed Heaven_Album Version),The Corrs,307,sad,"Let's read the trees and their autumn leaves As they fall like a dress undone At the end of summers, love will find lovers Who need the shadow of a winter's sun  Don't tell me you're leaving We can hide in the evening It's getting darker than it should If we read the leaves as they blow in the breeze Would it stop us now, my love?  Time enough for hard questions, time enough for all our fears Time is tougher than we both know yet time enough for tears  The moon is milk and the sky where it's spilt, it's magic And we all need to believe that we can wake in the dream It's not as hard as it seems you know, it's harder to leave  Time enough for being braver, time enough for all our fears Time is tougher than we both know yet time enough for tears  I heard you say underneath your breath some kind of prayer I heard you say underneath your breath That you never wanna feel this way about anybody else  Time enough for hard questions, time enough for all our fears Time, it's tougher than we both know yet time enough for tears Time enough for being braver, time enough I love this time of year Time, it's tough, it's running away from us time enough for tears Time enough... (I know, I know...) (It's OK, it's OK...)  "

8,A Thousand Kisses Deep,Leonard Cohen,386,relaxed,"The ponies run, the girls are young, The odds are there to beat. You win a while, and then it's done Your little winning streak. And summoned now to deal With your invincible defeat, You live your life as if it's real, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, I'm back on Boogie Street. You lose your grip, and then you slip Into the Masterpiece. And maybe I had miles to drive, And promises to keep: You ditch it all to stay alive, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  And sometimes when the night is slow, The wretched and the meek, We gather up our hearts and go, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  Confined to sex, we pressed against The limits of the sea: I saw there were no oceans left For scavengers like me. I made it to the forward deck. I blessed our remnant fleet And then consented to be wrecked, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, I'm back on Boogie Street. I guess they won't exchange the gifts That you were meant to keep. And quiet is the thought of you, The file on you complete, Except what we forgot to do, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  And sometimes when the night is slow, The wretched and the meek, We gather up our hearts and go, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  The ponies run, the girls are young, The odds are there to beat...  You win a while, and then it's done Your little winning streak. And summoned now to deal With your invincible defeat, You live your life as if it's real A Thousand Kisses Deep.  "
