I can't do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs, Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying, Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here. I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors, I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?

I think about the things I would never got to say to you, I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do. Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too, I still love your mother, that'll never change, Think about her every day, we just could never get it together. Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it, But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on anyday. There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains, Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain. But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame, I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint. I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history, But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say, I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way. But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm..  I'm going through changes Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...

It's why I tend to block out when I hear things Cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring (AHHHH!!!) So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz it'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this! I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her and have a son and a new brother at the same time and just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?

And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is To have run ya nav and who sulked us up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' I'm just willin' to be the bigger man If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin' Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin' I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers "

Through the week and can't get away And you're alone on the pier In West Palm Beach on your holiday Stormy night, reawake the stomach ache that i've acquired from feeling down, things look grim and i'm so sick of being tired apartment lights go dark and it's depressing but what can i do? the midnight streets feel dead when i am so used to driving with you brighter lights fill the night and bluer skys reflect in your eyes As I inspect and analyze All of these dreams I don't recognize if you're still up when the ships in the port prepare to set sail comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail inside my head you're voice is still resounding but what can i do? Empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun and think of me when you explore hidden coves and tiny island chains throughout the sea Can you still hear my voice when I'm outside from over the phone For what its worth darling dear I wish you were here Cause I feel alone when you were home we'd sing but since you've left I don't hear anything Though I feel so sad, I can't believe things are really that bad Old captains and brand new cruise ships Sailing over the briney sea When I crashed my beloved desk job And swim through the debris I'll cut loose leave this mad house,bound for the Atlantic blue I'll stroll down your treelined driveway and sail the ocean with you Happy Chinese Valentine's Day!

86,Much Farther To Go,Rosie Thomas,258,relaxed,"New York is lovely in the winter time All the sidewalks are white as snow The buildings, all the people that pass me by How the smile on his face says he's in love  I took the train all the way to Brooklyn Heights I remember when you took it there with me We sat side by side and held hands for some time We saluted the Statue of Liberty  I have much farther to go Everything is new and so unpredictable I should just kick my heels together and go home But I'm not sure where that is anymore  Oh how I wish I could go back in time To the night when I heard my mother cry She held me in her arms and we talked for some time And I sang a song her mother sang to her And it goes something about paper dolls and what men prefer Something about the cross and how her Jesus died for her Something about love and how it's worth living for I wonder does love like that exist anymore?  I have much farther to go I'm so confused I know I should just kick my heels together and go home But I lost my way when I lost you  Sometimes I cry when it's late at night And you're not there to lay next to me Morning breaks and the sun warms my face How I wish it was you warming me "
